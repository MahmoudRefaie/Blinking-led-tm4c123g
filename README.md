# Project introduction
This is a project in the Udacity Advanced Embedded System nanodegree. 

In this project you will control an LED blinking through variable PWM signal created by a timer, and defined by the LED driver user.

# Project Requirements
- Blinking LED control
- Control blinking of an LED for a user-defined ON and OFF periods
- Create a function in the App layer that takes as an input from the user a specific ON time and OFF time in seconds, lights a LED for the given ON time, and dim it for the given OFF time. Itâ€™s prohibited to use predefined delay functions, only timer driver functions can be used. This function implements implicitly the PWM module using Timer Overflow.

## Prepare project folders
- Create a COTS folder for the whole course including a folder for each layer in the layered architectureto include MCAL, HAL, SERVICE, APPLICATION, and LIBRARIES

## Implement the GPIO driver
- Create the GPIO driver from scratch using the sufficient interface,configure,private and program files
- Create functions in GPIO driver that are needed to perform the required project functionality

## Implement Timer driver
- Create the Timer driver from scratch using the sufficient interface,configure,private and program files
- Create functions in Timer driver that are needed to perform the required project functionality
- Creating a Timer Overflow ISR that performs the required functionality
- Passing the ISR as a callback function from App Layer to Timer driver in MCAL layer

## Implement interrupt driver
- Creating the Interrupt driver from scratch using the sufficient interface,configure,private and program files
- Create functions in Interrupt driver that are needed to perform the required project functionality

You should deliver a schematic/block diagram according to your understanding of the requirements.
